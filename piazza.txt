All
these
things
and
a
thousand
like
them
came
to
pass
in
and
close
upon
the
dear
old
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy-five
Environed
by
them
while
the
Woodman
and
the
Farmer
worked
unheeded
those
two
of
the
large
jaws
and
those
other
two
of
the
plain
and
the
fair
faces
trod
with
stir
enough
and
carried
their
divine
rights
with
a
high
hand
Thus
